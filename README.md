This Repository is to show the code that was used for developing a website. 
This website provided users a system for tuning a guitar or bass, store different tunings using a database to store them, record audio from the website and upload those recordings to a database. 
The user is required to register with the website and then log into the website to gain access to the websites functionality. 

The database is currently on a local machine on not live online as of yet. For this reason a demo on github isn't available at this moment. 
However the database code is in a file called DatabaseCode.sql with all the stored procedures. 
This means that the code can be downloaded so show you can do your own demo of the code. 
This website was developed as part of a higher diploma in software development.
